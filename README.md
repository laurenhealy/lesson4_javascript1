### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Variables are reserved words that that are used to store data in memory. In javascript, you can refer to a variable by name to see or change its value.
2. Global variables are declared outside a function and available to all parts of code. Whereas, a local variable is declared inside a function and only available within that function. It is better to avoid using global variables too frequently to avoid referencing the wrong variable multiple times in the code.
3. Javascript supports two types of numeric data. The first is integer which is a positive or negative number with no decimals and the second is floating-point number which contains decimal places or is written in exponential notation.
